# How well does a template and a dataset fit together?

When creating dashboards in grafiki, it's essential to understand how well a template and a dataset fit together. This is reflected in the Support Level, which indicates the compatibility between the two. Here's a breakdown of the Support Levels you'll encounter:

- **Badly supported** (‚õîÔ∏è): 0% support
  - **Tooltip:** "Probably no item from this element will work"
  - **Meaning:** Unfortunately, the template and dataset are not compatible, and most items will likely not work as intended.
- **Partly supported** (üü†): 1% - 99% support
  - **Tooltip:** "Not all items from this element will work"
  - **Meaning:** The template and dataset have some compatibility issues, but some items might still work. Expect potential errors or inconsistencies.
- **Fully supported** (‚úÖ): 100% support
  - **Tooltip:** "This element is fully supported"
  - **Meaning:** Congratulations! The template and dataset are perfectly compatible, and all items should work seamlessly.

By understanding the Support Level, you can make informed decisions when creating dashboards in grafiki, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience.

Remember, a higher Support Level indicates better compatibility and fewer potential issues.
