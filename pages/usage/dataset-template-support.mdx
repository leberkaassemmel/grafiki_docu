# How well does a template and a dataset fit together?

When creating dashboards in grafiki, it's essential to understand how well a template and a dataset fit together. This is reflected in the Support Level, which indicates the compatibility between the two. Here's a breakdown of the Support Levels you'll encounter:

- **Badly supported** (⛔️):
  Unfortunately, the template and dataset are not compatible, and most items will likely not work as intended.
- **Partly supported** (🟠):
  The template and dataset have some compatibility issues, but some items might still work. Expect potential errors or inconsistencies.
- **Fully supported** (✅):
  Congratulations! The template and dataset are perfectly compatible, and all items should work seamlessly.

By understanding the Support Level, you can make informed decisions when creating dashboards in grafiki, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience.

Remember, a higher Support Level indicates better compatibility and fewer potential issues.
