# Template Selection

grafiki's template feature allows you to define the structure and layout of your dashboards without holding any data. This template information is stored in the IndexedDB, alongside your datasets.

## Template Structure

The template structure is a JSON object that contains all properties needed for creating the dashboard. The structure can be found [here](/api-documentation/template). Templates are stored in the IndexedDB from the browser.

## Filtering

The selection interface is designed to provide a seamless experience for finding and selecting the right template for your needs. The UI features a search bar at the top for filtering available datasets.

## Template Card

Each template is displayed as a card, providing a concise overview of the template's details. The card includes:

- **Title**: The name of the template, displayed prominently at the top of the card.
- **Metadata**: Information about the template, such as the number of columns and rows.
- **Support Level**: See [here](/usage/dataset-template-support) for more information.
- **Items**: A preview of the items in the template, with icons representing the item type.
- **Actions**: Three buttons at the bottom of the card allow you to:

  - **Choose**: Select the template for creating a dashboard.
  - **More**: Access additional options and actions for the template.
  - **Delete**: Remove the template from your local storage.
