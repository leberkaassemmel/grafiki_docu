### Step 1: Open Grafiki

Welcome to Grafiki! Start by opening the app at [www.grafiki.app](http://www.grafiki.app). We're excited to have you on board!

### Step 2: Choose Your Dataset

### Step 3: Create a Template

If you're new to Grafiki, an empty template will be created for you. Don't worry, we'll help you fill it up in no time!

### Step 4: Add Your First Item

You can either add a new item manually or set up an assistant to help you with the process. The assistant is here to guide you through the creation process, making it easy to get started.

### Step 5: Customize Your Item

In the Edit menu, you can change the main data, filter the data, add shapes, change the axis, and let the assistant help you with suggestions.
